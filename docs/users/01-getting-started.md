# Getting started
To get started with using DuoCash you need to have the following: 
- A modern browser (Chrome/Firefox/Brave)
- A wallet such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), [Frame](https://frame.sh/) or [TrustWallet](https://trustwallet.com/)
- Funds to pay for the transactions (cost is dependent on the chain you are using)
