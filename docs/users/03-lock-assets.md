# Lock assets
DuoCash supports a large amount of assets, here we describe the process of locking them for the most common asset types.

## Locking tokens
Click on the "Actions" button, then click on the "Lock Tokens" button.

Click on "Pick a token", you can now search the token list for the token you want to lock. If the token you want to lock is not in the list you can paste the token address in the searchbar. Click on the token to select it.

Type the amount you wish to send in the amount field (or click on "Balance" to use the maximum amount available).

Click on "Send Transaction", your metamask will then pop-up and ask for confirmation. 

## Locking NFTs
Click on the "Actions" button, then click on the "Lock NFT" button.

Paste the contract address of the NFT and the Token ID. Then click "Send Transaction" to send the NFT to the locker.

## Locking ownership
Locking ownership is a more complex process and (as of now) does not have a UI. 

To get started find the address of the locker, this is shown on the locker page next to "Locker address".

Transfer ownership to the locker address (make sure both the locker and the contract are on the same chain, mistakes are non-reversible!)
