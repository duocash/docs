DuoCash lockers are a tool to lock assets, it can be used for multiple usecases:
- Locking tokens (<code>ERC20</code>, <code>ERC1155</code>)
- Locking LP tokens (Uniswap, Pancakeswap etc.)
- Locking Uniswap V3 Positions
- Locking NFTs (<code>ERC721</code>, <code>ERC1155</code>)
- Tokenizing ownership / Locking ownership of a contract (<code>ERC173</code>)

The ownership of every locker is managed by an NFT, this NFT can be resold on secondary markets or used in protocols. ([example of an ownership NFT](https://opensea.io/assets/0x00D3216403eD04C57038c5aABc839728D27061D8/1))
